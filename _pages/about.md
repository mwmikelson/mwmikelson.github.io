About Me
======
I am currently a senior honors student at the Unviersity of Michigan, majoring in Political Science and minoring in Data Science. My primary research interests are international conflict and human rights, with a secondary interest in methodology. Currently I'm working on my senior thesis which looks at the measurement of militarization and the association between change in militarization and instances of armed interstate conflict.
